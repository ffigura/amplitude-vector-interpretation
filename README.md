## About

This paper has been submitted for publication in the journal *Journal of Applied Geophysics*.

This repository contains the source code to perform the synthetic tests presented. The `generate_input.py` generates the synthetic data, the codes `High_I_D.py`, `Mid_I_D.py` and `Low_I_D.py` compute the amplitude of the magnetic anomaly vector andthe codes `High_I_D_plot.py`, `Mid_I_D_plot.py` and `Low_I_D_plot.py` generate the figures of the synthetic test.

The programs are compatible with Python 2.7 programming language.
 
## Abstract

We propose the use of the amplitude of the magnetic vector (amplitude data) for qualitative interpreting large areas at low magnetic latitudes. The amplitude data are weakly dependent on the magnetization direction. Hence, the amplitude data require no prior knowledge of the source magnetization direction. The amplitude data produce maxima over the causative sources, allowing the definition of the horizontal projections of the sources. This characteristic is attractive for interpretation at low magnetic latitudes because at these regions the interpretation of the total-field anomaly is not straightforward. We compute the amplitude data using the equivalent-layer technique to transform the total-field anomaly data into the three orthogonal components of the magnetic anomaly vector. We analyze the results of tests in synthetic data simulating a main geomagnetic field at high, mid and low latitudes, with sources ranging from compact to elongated forms, including a dipping source. These sources, that give rise to the simulated anomalies, have both induced and strong remanent magnetizations. By comparing the amplitude data with the total gradient, we show that the amplitude data delineate the boundaries of the sources in a better way. We apply both the amplitude data and the total gradient to a real total-field anomaly over a large area of the Amazonian Craton, northern Brazil, located at low magnetic latitudes. The amplitude data show a better performance in delineating geologic bodies being consistent with the outcropping intrusions in the geologic map. Moreover, the amplitude data revealed new geologic bodies that were not present in the geologic map. The clear alignment of these new bodies with the outcropping intrusions suggested the continuity of these intrusions in depth. This result is a step forward in understanding this area, which has a poor geological knowledge. Hence, the amplitude data can provide an apparent-geologic map especially in areas at low latitudes with remanent magnetized bodies.

## Dependencies

The Python programs for compute the syntehtic data - "generate_input.py" - and the amplitude of the magnetic anomaly vector - "X_I_D.py" - require the Python library "numpy" and the last development version of the free Python packaged "Fatiando a Terra" ( https://www.fatiando.org/dev/install.html#installing-the-latest-development-version ). The script "X_plot.py" requires the same Python packages in addtion to "matplotlib". 

The easier way to get Python and all libraries installed is through the Anaconda Python 
distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). After installed Anaconda, install the libraries 
by running the following command in your terminal:

	conda install numpy matplotlib

The programs are compatible with Python 2.7.

## Reproducing the results

The results and figures for the synthetic test are reproducible from the folders `/High_I_D`, `/Mid_I_D` and `/Low_I_D`.
Running the code `generate_input.py` will generate the synthetic data, the code `X_I_D.py` will allow the reprodution of the results and the code `X_I_D_plot.py` will generate the figures. For more information read the file `README.MD` or `README.txt` in the folder `/code`.
